            <h1>Notes from DTU: Engineering Culture & The Erasmus Spirit</h1>
            <p class="meta-info">Published on December 20, 2024 • Lyngby, Denmark</p>

        <article class="article-content">
            <p>
                There is something disarming about walking into a lecture hall at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and hearing a student call a world-renowned professor by their first name. No "Sir," no "Professor," just "Lars" or "Mette."
            </p>
            <p>
                My semester in Lyngby was more than just a deep dive into advanced algorithms; it was a masterclass in a different way of thinking. Coming from the rigorous, theoretically heavy environment of Southern Europe, the Danish model felt like a shock to the system—in the best possible way.
            </p>

            <h2>The "Flat Hierarchy" of Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing that strikes you is the lack of barriers. In Building 324, where I spent most of my nights coding, the architecture itself is transparent—glass walls, open spaces. This reflects the academic culture. You aren't just memorizing formulas; you are expected to challenge them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember a group project on optimization where we got stuck. We knocked on our supervisor's door, expecting a formal appointment for next week. Instead, he invited us in for coffee, sat on the table (not the chair), and we spent an hour brainstorming as equals. That psychological safety accelerates learning faster than any textbook.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                "In Denmark, the education system is free for EU citizens, and students even get paid a stipend (SU) to study. This removes the survival anxiety I've seen elsewhere. People study here because they are genuinely curious, not because they are terrified of failing."
            </div>

            <h2>Basecamp: More Than Just a Room</h2>
            <p>
                One of the highlights of my stay was living at <strong>Basecamp</strong>. I was incredibly lucky to secure a spot there, as it’s notorious for filling up instantly. It wasn't just a student residence; it felt like living in the future of housing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern, sustainable, and equipped with everything you could need (from cinemas to gyms), it was the perfect base of operations. But more importantly, it was a melting pot of cultures. Cooking dinner in the shared kitchens meant hearing five different languages at once.
            </p>

            <h2>The Erasmus Spirit: Travels & Community</h2>
            <p>
                While the academic rigor was high, the Erasmus experience is defined by the people. I was fortunate to find a fantastic group of Spaniards—fellow engineers and scientists with whom I shared this journey. Having that "family" away from home made all the difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                We took full advantage of our location in Northern Europe. Beyond the stunning streets of <strong>Copenhagen</strong>—which is undeniably one of the most beautiful and well-designed cities I’ve ever seen—we used our weekends to explore. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We traveled to the imperial palaces of <strong>Vienna</strong>, walked the snowy archipelagos of <strong>Stockholm</strong>, and explored the ruin bars of <strong>Budapest</strong>. These trips were the essence of the Erasmus spirit: working hard during the week on neural networks, and catching a cheap flight on Friday to wake up in a completely new culture on Saturday.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leaving Denmark, I'm taking with me more than just credits. I'm taking the conviction that rigorous engineering works best when balanced with a vibrant, international life.
