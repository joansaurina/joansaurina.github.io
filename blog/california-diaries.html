            <h1>Stateside Observations: The Scale of California</h1>
            <p class="meta-info">Published on November 15, 2025 • Palo Alto, CA</p>

        <article class="article-content">
            <p>
                Living in the United States—specifically the tech hub of California—has been an exercise in adjusting my sense of scale. Coming from Europe, where cities are dense and walkable, the American model of living feels like a completely different operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few months based in Palo Alto, here are the things that have shocked me the most (and the things I’ve fallen in love with).
            </p>

            <h2>The Infrastructure of Patience</h2>
            <p>
                As an engineer, I can't help but look at the road network with confusion. In Europe, we solved traffic flow with roundabouts decades ago. Here, they are virtually non-existent. Instead, you have massive intersections with 4-minute red lights. You sit there, watching an empty road, waiting for a signal to change. It’s an efficiency nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, where are the tunnels? In Spain or Switzerland, if there is a mountain, we bore through it. Here, the roads wind over everything. It feels like there has been a lack of heavy infrastructure investment compared to the sheer size of the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This leads to the biggest reality check: <span class="highlight-text">You need a car. 100%.</span> The concept of a "15-minute city" does not exist here. Everything is huge, separated, and spread out. If you plan to stay long-term, a vehicle isn’t a luxury; it’s a prosthetic limb you need to survive.
            </p>

            <h2>Fast Food & Dining Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The accessibility of food is overwhelming. Drive-thrus are everywhere, and the habit of eating out is deeply ingrained. It’s not just a treat; for many, it’s the default mode of feeding themselves. The convenience is unmatched, but coming from the Mediterranean diet, the sheer volume of processed options is a culture shock in itself.
            </p>

            <h2>The Magic: Curry, Hollywood, and Yosemite</h2>
            <p>
                However, once you accept the car dependence, the access to world-class experiences is unbelievable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>San Francisco</strong> has a unique energy—seeing the fog roll over the bridge and feeling the pulse of the tech world is inspiring. But nothing beats the atmosphere of the Chase Center. I fulfilled a childhood dream watching the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong>. Seeing <strong>Stephen Curry</strong> play live is different—it’s not just basketball; it’s physics in motion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then, there is the nature. I took road trips to <strong>Lake Tahoe</strong> and <strong>Yosemite National Park</strong>, and "brutal" is the only word to describe it. Standing in front of El Capitan makes you feel incredibly small. The scale of the American landscape is humbling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also drove down to <strong>Los Angeles</strong>. Walking through Hollywood felt like walking through a movie set I’ve known all my life. It’s chaotic, yes, but culturally magnetic.
            </p>

            <p>
                California is a land of extremes—extreme traffic, extreme distances, but also extreme beauty and talent. It’s a complex place, but I’m glad I have the chance to decode it.
